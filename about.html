                <h4 class="subheading">Why?</h4>

                <p>
                    ComURide is an application developed to solve the rush hour traffic congestions in Lagos state and beyond. It is built on the power of ride sharing by people with common interests and goals. ComURide was created to disrupt the way people (especially workers) go to and fro work on daily basis through useful connections of people with similar interests and likes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The population of Lagos State is said to be over 20 million. The economy of the state is distinctively shared between two main locations namely the Island and Mainland settlements. While the Island is seen to be the corporate headquarters of the state, the Mainland aside from housing the seat of government, is also diverse in terms of commercial and corporate activities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is also a clear difference in the socio-economic status of the two settlements. Lifestyle on the Island settlement is pretty much expensive compared to that of the Mainland and this is mainly evident in the cost of accommodation in the area. 
                    Due to the exorbitant rent charged by property owners, most people that have their workplaces located on the island tend to take up accommodation on the Mainland and as a result must travel long distances to go to work on the Island.
                </p>
                    These usually put pressure on both the inbound and outbound Island traffic thereby causing many people to spend a lot of hours on traffic while going to or closing from work. The vehicular movement during the peak or rush hours of the day are usually terrible. Millions of cars find their way into the Island every day.
                    These cars are basically driven by people that either have their workplace or businesses situated on the island and since most offices open by 8am and close between 4pm and 6pm, the dreadful traffic situations tend to peak at these hours.
                        
                </p>

                <h4 class="subheading">Our Vision</h4>

                <p>
                    We envision that this platform will eventually culminate into a force that will help to strengthen the spirit of community-ness amongst people.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subheading">The Objective</h4>

                <p>
                    Our objective is simple and it is:to improve our world! ComURide is helping people build relationships and connections that can bring about unity, oneness and togetherness and above all, making our communities green again.
